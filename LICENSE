The parties agree to replace any such invalid provision with a valid provision that most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the invalid provision. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties relating to this subject matter and supersedes all prior and/or simultaneous representations, discussions, negotiations and agreements relating to the ADK, whether written or oral.
